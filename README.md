NGO Collaboration Suite Project
## Idea / Problem Statement
The NGO Collaboration Suite is a digital platform that enables NGOs to work together efficiently on shared goals. It supports project tracking, resource sharing, and real-time collaboration through shared dashboards and communication tools. Aligned with UN SDG 17, the platform fosters transparency and reduces duplication of efforts. Volunteers and donors worldwide can engage by contributing time, skills, or funds. With multilingual support and mobile accessibility, it’s designed for inclusivity and grassroots impact. By streamlining operations and enhancing accountability, the suite helps NGOs focus on creating meaningful, measurable change in the communities they serve.
